# Topic 7 Control
(computersciencewiki.org)

> transducer - converts energy type to another (both sensors and actuators are transducers)
> Actuator - includes both sensors and actuators; device which converts variations in a physical quantity into electrical signal or vice versa
> Device driver - computer program which controls or allows to function a device or peripheral
> Analogue-Digital Converter (AD) - system which converts analog signal from a sensor to digital signal

## Feedback systems
### Open loop
> Considers the input then just operates the task (pushing a button and walking away)
- Toaster

### Closed loop

> Takes the output's effects into account
- Water heater *control system* which continuously monitors the temperature, changing input accordingly

## Microprocessor

> Only has a CPU

- Processes faster than a human could
- Fast reactions to changes in a system
- Works in dangerous locations
- May cost a lot of money
- Limited scope of programming

## Microcontroller 

> Has a CPU in addition to RAM/ROM/etc embedded on a single chip

## Sensors

- Heat, humidity, infrared, light, pH, Pressure, smoke, sound, tilt, touch, etc

## Actuators

> Actuators allow a system to act on its surroundings in some way

- LED
- Heater
- Cooling unit
- pump
- speaker

## Distributed system vs Centrally controlled system
(John Rayworth definitions)
> Centrally controlled system - A hardware and/or software IT system in which all parts of it are controlled by a central controller/server/mainframe.

- More control/administration
- Slower access
- Response (output) is based on the average instead of the specific

> Distributed system: is a system in which components located on networked computers communicate and coordinate their actions by passing messages. The components interact with each other in order to achieve a common goal.

- More complex administration
- Less control
- Quicker to access
- Share the processing load
- More specific output response

## Autonomous agents?

Software entity which does a set of tasks based on the wishes of a user with a degree of independence
